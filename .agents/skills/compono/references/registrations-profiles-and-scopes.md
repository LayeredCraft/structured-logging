# Registrations, profiles, rules, scopes, and shared values

How to make Compono use a specific value/factory/instance instead of
generating one from scratch, and how identity/sharing works across a
composed graph.

## `Register<T>()` — exact-type registration

```csharp
builder.Register<IClock>(context => new SystemClock());
builder.Register<int>(() => 42);
```

Pipeline stage 3, exact-type-keyed. **A second `Register<T>()` for the
same `T`** — direct, via a profile, or across two profiles — **is a
build-time `CompositionConfigurationException`, not last-write-wins.**
This is the single biggest AutoFixture-habit trap: AutoFixture
customizations happily re-customize the same type; Compono throws. If two
things both want to configure `T`, consolidate into one registration —
don't stack a second one hoping it overrides the first.

`UseServiceProvider(IServiceProvider provider)` is a stage-3 fallback,
tried only after every exact `Register<T>()` misses. Compono calls
`GetService(Type)` directly — it never creates, resolves from, or
disposes a scope on your behalf. Calling it twice is also a conflict.

## Type/member rules — `.For<T>()`

```csharp
builder.For<string>().Use("from-type-rule");
builder.For<Customer>().Member(x => x.Email).Use("literal@example.com");
builder.For<Order>().Member(x => x.PlacedAt)
    .Use(context => context.Resolve<IClock>().UtcNow);
```

A member rule always wins over a type rule for the same value
(specificity-based dispatch, not call order). `.Member(...)` requires a
**direct** property/field access expression — `x => x.Email.Length`
throws `ArgumentException` immediately at the `.Member(...)` call, not
deferred to composition time. A duplicate rule for the same type, or the
same (type, member) pair, is a build-time conflict, same as
`Register<T>()`.

Don't reuse a member rule across unrelated types hoping it'll apply
broadly — if a rule should really apply everywhere, use a type rule or
`Register<T>()` instead, not a copy-pasted member rule per type.

## `ICompositionProfile`

```csharp
public sealed class OrderTestProfile : ICompositionProfile
{
    public void Configure(CompositionBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.UseNSubstitute();
        builder.Register<IClock>(_ => new FixedClock(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow));
    }
}

var composer = Composer.Create(b => b.AddProfile<OrderTestProfile>());
// or: b.AddProfile(new OrderTestProfile());
```

- Pure configuration, applied synchronously exactly once.
- `AddProfile<TProfile>()` requires a parameterless constructor;
  `AddProfile(instance)` for one that doesn't.
- Multiple `AddProfile<...>()` calls all apply, in the order added.
- A profile applying itself (directly or through nesting) is a
  `CompositionConfigurationException` (`ProfileCycle`), immediately — not
  a silent no-op.
- A profile is configuration, not a base class, lifecycle hook, or place
  for assertions.

**Prefer several small, focused profiles** (`InfrastructureProfile`,
`DomainProfile`) named after the *concern* they configure, not the
consumer/test class that happens to use them — don't grow one giant
catch-all profile.

## Custom providers — matching on request shape, including name

`Register<T>()`/`.For<T>()` are exact-type-keyed. When a value genuinely
needs to vary by the **requesting parameter/member's own name**, not just
its type — several distinct values of the same declared type, chosen by
which parameter is asking — write a custom `ICompositionValueProvider`
instead:

```csharp
public sealed class UpsellPayloadProvider : ICompositionValueProvider
{
    public CompositionProviderResult TryProvide(in CompositionProviderRequest request, ICompositionContext context)
    {
        if (request.RequestedType != typeof(UpsellPayload))
            return CompositionProviderResult.NotHandled;

        return request.Name switch
        {
            "newGamePayload" => CompositionProviderResult.Handled(new UpsellPayload("new-game")),
            "lockedPackPayload" => CompositionProviderResult.Handled(new UpsellPayload("locked-pack")),
            _ => CompositionProviderResult.NotHandled,
        };
    }
}

builder.AddSemanticProvider(new UpsellPayloadProvider());
// or AddTestDoubleProvider(...), depending on what it produces
```

`CompositionProviderRequest.Name` carries the requesting constructor
parameter/required member/test-method-parameter's own name — this is a
**global rule** ("whenever anything asks for `UpsellPayload` named
`newGamePayload`, produce this"), evaluated for every matching request
across every test. Reserve this for the case that genuinely needs to
match on request shape rather than a fixed type — most AutoFixture
specimen builders migrate to a plain `Register<T>()` instead (see
`patterns-and-antipatterns.md`'s mapping table).

**Don't confuse this with `[Compose<TProfile, TConfig>]`'s profile
configuration arguments** (`xunit-v3.md`) — a `Name`-based provider is a
global rule keyed off the requesting parameter's name; a profile
configuration argument is a per-invocation value known only at one
specific test's call site. They solve different problems and aren't
interchangeable.

## Scopes and recursion

A type appearing twice in a graph is **not** automatically a cycle — a
genuine cycle is a type whose *construction is still in progress* when
re-requested. That fails fast with a path-annotated `CompositionException`
— there is no AutoFixture `OmitOnRecursionBehavior` equivalent. Break a
real self-reference with an explicit `Register<T>()` factory that
supplies the recursive edge deliberately (e.g. `null`, or a pre-built
instance) instead of asking Compono to silently omit it.

## `[Shared]` (`Compono.XunitV3` only)

```csharp
[Theory]
[Compose]
public void ServiceUsesTheSharedRepository(
    [Shared] Repository repository,
    OrderService service)
{
    // `service`'s internally-composed Repository dependency
    // is reference-equal to `repository`.
}
```

- Type-keyed, not name-keyed: every parameter or nested dependency
  requesting exactly that type within the row reuses the same instance.
- `[Shared]` parameters resolve first, in declaration order, before
  non-shared parameters — so anything depending on the shared instance
  always sees it already available.
- Two `[Shared]` parameters of the same type on one method is an error —
  there's no way to know which one is "the" shared value.
- **Not a core `Compono` concept** — plain `composer.Create<T>()` has no
  notion of a "row" to scope sharing to. `[Shared]` only exists inside
  `Compono.XunitV3`'s `[Compose]` row. Don't suggest `[Shared]` for a
  programmatic (non-`[Compose]`) composition — use a `Register<T>()`
  factory that returns the same captured instance instead.

**Don't overuse `[Shared]`.** It's for a real identity requirement (the
system under test and the assertion need to reference the *same*
instance), not "make things consistent" and not a performance
optimization — ordinary composition is already cheap. When migrating from
AutoFixture's `[Frozen]`, audit each usage: many `[Frozen]` interface
parameters were only there to get a substitute in the first place, not to
share it — once `Compono.NSubstitute`'s `UseNSubstitute()` is active,
composing an interface already produces a substitute automatically, and
no `[Shared]` is needed unless identity actually matters.
